# medical-image-processing
During the module of biomedical imaging, I created a platform of acquisition, manipulation and saving of 1D and 2D signals with the Matlab software. This platform is composed of 2 parts: In a first place the processing of 1D and
2D signals: acquisition, filtering (median, sobel, adaptive, Prewitt, ...) and generation of signals (echograms).In a 2nd place: the quality control of the radiographic and MRI images. In this part the platform, the control of the
CNR and SNR ratio of the ibm and generates the corresponding parameters (homogeneity, contrast, energy, correlation, ...). Finally the platform calls the ImajeJ software which allows the manipulation of the images.
